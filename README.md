## Earthquake Application

This application, called EarthquakeFrame, is a graphical user 
interface (GUI) tool designed to monitor and display 
earthquake data retrieved from a backend service. 
The application provides a list of earthquakes based on 
user-selected time intervals (One Hour or 30 Days) and allows 
users to view detailed earthquake information on Google Maps.
